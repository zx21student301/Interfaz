r6operators
================

r6operators is a collection of high-quality vectorized Rainbow Six: Siege Operator icons & metadata for Node.js.

This project started as way for people to get high-resolution operator icons for Rainbow Six: Siege operators,
especially as vector graphics gained popularity in web development in the recent years.
All icons have been remade by hand and they got the same aspect ratio & alignment for more consistent usage.

This zip file contains the icon files in the following file formats:
  PNG: High-resolution static image
  SVG: Scalable vector graphic (for websites/applications)
